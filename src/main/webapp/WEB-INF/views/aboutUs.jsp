            <p>Finally. A prototype online solution to evolve your rent experience.
                Easyrent.com's mission is to empower the property rental market through technology.
                Our vision is a world where the rental property management business is easy and automated,
                there's a higher standard of service, and background checks are a thing of the past.
                At Easyrent.com, Renter's can build a profile and rapport with landlord's over time to act as their background report.
                Our intuitive, all-in-one rental property management platform is transforming the rental experience by connecting renters,
                property managers, and realtors online;to simplify the process for everyone involved.
                We're building an online community of renters and owners that allows everyone to communicate and meet their individual goals:
                whether it's finding the ideal place to live hassle-free, paying or accepting rent, or managing a property more efficiently to increase revenue and renter satisfaction.
